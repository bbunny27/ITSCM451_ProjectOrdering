### Goals:
Your task is to develop a Serverless Order Processing System that allows customers to place orders for
products. The system should:
1. Handle customer data, order information, and product inventory.
2. Process orders in real-time, including stock validation and order confirmation.
3. Send notifications (email or SMS) to customers when their order is confirmed

### Additional Info:
The site uses only html, css, and javascript. All python code exists in AWS Lambda Functions.   
All code is AI generated and lightly tweaked. AI Code is an intended part of the assignment.
